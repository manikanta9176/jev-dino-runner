# dFlow MCP

Use this skill to connect an editor and to operate a workspace that already exists. Use `dflow-deploy` to create an application, attach compute, and ship a service.

## Connect

- Transport: streamable HTTP at `https://app.dflow.sh/api/mcp`
- Server card: `https://dflow.sh/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`
- OAuth discovery: `https://dflow.sh/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- Protected resource: `https://dflow.sh/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
- Auth notes: `https://dflow.sh/auth.md`
- Docs: https://docs.dflow.sh/articles/3167609-dflow-mcp

OAuth only. Do not invent an API key or an `Authorization` header in config.

Cursor and VS Code can install the server from a link. Other clients add this config and finish OAuth in the browser:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dflow": {
      "url": "https://app.dflow.sh/api/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Manual OAuth, when the client does not open a browser for you:

1. Register a public client at `https://app.dflow.sh/api/oauth/register` with `token_endpoint_auth_method: "none"`.
2. Send the user to `https://app.dflow.sh/oauth/authorize` with `response_type=code`, PKCE `S256`, and scope `mcp`.
3. Exchange the code at `https://app.dflow.sh/api/oauth/token`.
4. Call MCP with `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.

Tokens are RS256 JWTs from `https://app.dflow.sh`. JWKS is `https://app.dflow.sh/.well-known/jwks.json`. One organisation per sign-in. The tools use the same role as the dashboard.

Install the skill pack with `npx skills add dflow-sh/skills`.

## Find a resource

Application → Environment (one worker node) → Service (app, database, or Docker) → Deployment

- `list_applications` / `get_application_by_id` / `update_application` (name or description only)
- `list_environments` / `get_environment_by_id` / `update_environment` (name or default flag only)
- `set_default_environment` to pin the application default
- `list_services` / `get_service_by_id` (id or case-insensitive name)
- `list_worker_nodes` / `get_worker_node_by_id`

Lists are depth 0 and paginate with `cursor` and `limit`. Resolve a service before logs, deploys, domains, or scale. Do not guess ids.

Reads that do not need a confirmation: `list_applications`, `get_application_by_id`, `list_environments`, `get_environment_by_id`, `list_services`, `get_service_by_id`, `get_deployments_by_service_id`, `get_deployment_logs`, `get_service_runtime_logs`, `list_templates`, `get_template_by_id`, `list_docker_registries`, `list_github_git_providers`, `list_github_repositories`, `list_github_branches`.

Every other tool is a mutation. Name the resource and confirm before calling it.

## Logs

- Build and deploy logs belong to a deployment: `get_deployments_by_service_id`, then `get_deployment_logs`.
- Runtime logs belong to the service: `get_service_runtime_logs`.

Deploy diagnosis: `get_service_by_id` → `get_deployments_by_service_id` → `get_deployment_logs` → `get_service_runtime_logs` only if the service is running. Then `restart_service`, `stop_service`, `redeploy_from_deployment`, or `cancel_deployment` after the user agrees.

## Domains

1. `list_service_domains`
2. `update_service_domain` to add or remove a hostname. This also syncs the proxy.
3. `check_domain_dns_status` with the service id and hostname.
4. `mark_default_service_domain` to set the default.

## Scale and resources

Call the status tool first. Do not pass report strings into the set tools.

- `get_service_scale_status`, then `scale_service`. `presetKey` (`small` 1, `medium` 2, `large` 3) scales the web process only. `processScales` keys are `web`, `worker`, and `scheduler`. This does not set CPU or memory.
- `get_service_resource_status`, then `set_service_resource_limits` or `set_service_resource_reserves`. CPU is cores (0.5–2). Memory is MiB (512–4096). Limit presets: `small` 0.5/512, `medium` 0.5/1024, `large` 1/2048. Reserves have no presets and need a process type. `clear_service_resource_limits` and `clear_service_resource_reserves` need `processType`: `web`, `worker`, `scheduler`, or `_default_`. Resource changes need a deploy.

## Database backups

Self-managed compute only. ClickHouse is unsupported. Destination is saved on the database service, not on each snapshot. `create_backup` and the schedule use that saved destination. They do not take a destination argument. Connecting a storage provider is dashboard-only.

1. `list_backup_storage_providers` (credentials are redacted).
2. `update_service_backup_destination` with `internal`, or `external` plus a verified provider id.
3. `create_backup` with the service id. Poll `list_service_backups` until success or failed. `list_backups` lists snapshots for the whole organisation.
4. `update_backup_schedule` for hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly. It does not change the destination.

Confirm before `restore_backup` or `delete_backup`. Restore overwrites the live database. Delete destroys the dump.

Import a dump without sending bytes through MCP:

1. `request_dump_upload`
2. HTTP PUT the file to `uploadUrl`
3. `restore_from_uploaded_dump` with `stagingKey` set to the returned key and `confirm: true`

Download: `request_backup_download`. External storage returns `downloadUrl` immediately. Internal storage may return `preparing`; poll `get_backup_download_url`, then HTTP GET `downloadUrl`.

## Templates, GitHub, and registries

- `list_templates` by official, community, or personal. `get_template_by_id` needs id and type. `create_template` and `update_template_by_id` are personal templates only.
- `deploy_template_to_application` ships the template. Do not call `create_deployment` after it. See `dflow-deploy`.
- GitHub: `list_github_git_providers`, `prepare_github_app_registration`, `connect_public_github_app`, `get_github_app_install_url`, `list_github_repositories`, `list_github_branches`. App registration and install still finish in the browser.
- Docker registries: `list_docker_registries`, `create_docker_registry`, `update_docker_registry_by_id`. A connection test runs first. A failed test saves nothing.

## What stays redacted

Service reads replace literal secrets with `[REDACTED]`. `{{ reference }}` templates may still appear. Worker-node reads hide SSH keys, raw IP addresses, MagicDNS, and plugin config. Do not paste git or registry tool output into a public place.

Adding a worker node, and connecting backup storage credentials, are dashboard-only.
